Description: This package analyses hiCLIP data. It starts with barcode processing and hybrid read selection followed by alignment. (These functions use Cutadapt, Bowtie2, Samtools and Sambamba.) Then PCR duplicates are removed and there are downstream analysis functions as in the original hiCLIP paper.
